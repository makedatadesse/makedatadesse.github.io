        <p>Conversations with the Self: Artist reflections + Notes from interviews</p>

<!--Description-->
<p class="description">Artists within this exhibition were asked to reflect on their experiences of identity as first and second generation diaspora – in their youth, as young adults, and now, as artists. What came of this were conversations that revealed a shared practice of creation as a means of searching for the Self; family and community members become symbols: portals to access memory, nostalgia, and ancestry.

That experience was traumatizing for me as a kid and it colored so much of who I am today. It shaped some of my core wounds of abandonment and loss... a part of me is always trying to reconcile with that trauma, especially through my writing. I didn’t have the language to explain or even process what I was experiencing and feeling as a kid. And now that I have that ability, every time I allow myself to write about it, I feel like I’m giving voice to my inner child. It’s healing.”</li></ul>

The mezmur, the incense and the people there were always a grounding force for me."</li></ul>

                <ul style="list-style-type: none;"><li><a class="A">A:</a> “Space and physicality’s relationship to a sense of identity is very important, especially in this country. Owning property is an affirmation of one’s existence as a citizen of this country. As someone from a nomadic background, ownership is not as strict and codified as it is in this country. We understood our relationship to the land as unfixed constantly moving and in relation to it. When reading the stars to navigate upcoming storms and weather events. When constructing your “Guri” –the temporary home that nomadic Somalis would construct in relation to the land it was being constructed upon. The relationship we have with land is not one of property or ownership but rather of mutual understanding of temporality and survival. Space is no longer a fixed thing of ownership but rather it has its purpose and existence greater than we can imagine. I try to understand this relationship by allowing space to just exist on the canvas naturally, without trying to control the composition."</li></ul>

My past was filled with great meals and specific dishes bring me back to some of the most innocent times of my life.
